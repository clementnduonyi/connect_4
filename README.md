# Project: TDD Connect Four #

# Intro #

 It’s a basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

 The game rules are fairly straightforward and you’ll play it on the command line.

 The interesting thing is that, I wrote a test was written before writting code for the game to pass the test for what TDD is.
